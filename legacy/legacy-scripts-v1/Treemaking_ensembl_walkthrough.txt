01. Download the coding sequences of the species of interest for your phylogeny from the Ensembl FTP site.

02. Filter out any redundant sequences with isofilter.py

		python isofilter.py

03. Download the list of orthologous sequences between all your species from Ensembl BioMart. Ensembl only allows a download
	of 6 species at a time, so if your phylogeny has more than 6 species you will have to download multiple lists with at least
	one species in common and then combine the lists with orth_combine.py

		python orth_combine.py

04. Combine orthologous sequences from filtered genomes from step 2 using the list from step 4.

		python get_orth_fasta.py

05. Re-label the FASTA title headers with consistent species names in the firest field. Trim FASTA headers if necessary.

		python fasta_label.py

**COMBINE STEPS 5+6 (DONE)

07. Align sequences.

		python run_muscle.py
		-or-
		python run_pasta_aln.py

08. Mask alignments.

		python run_gblocks.py

09. Get alignment stats.

		python count_aln.py

10. Make gene trees and combine the best trees into one file.

		python run_raxml.py

----
Average consensus

11. Run the average consensus method in SDM (implement this?)

		sdm -i [input file] -d [SDM, SDM*, or ACS97 methods] -t T -f Phylip_square

12. Take the distance matrix from SDM and create a neighbor joining tree. Continue with divergence time estimation in r8s if necessary.

		python supertreemaker.py

----
ASTRAL

11. Remove the first line listing the number of trees from the combined best tree list output of run_raxml.

12. Run ASTRAL

		astral -i [input file] -o [output file]
