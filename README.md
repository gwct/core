# CORE: COde for Romps in Evolutionary data
### A mixture of scripts and libraries to help with sequence data manipulation, tree parsing, and other things.

## About
These scripts can be used for many tasks including sequence handling, tree making, and sequence alignment.
Some of these programs are mainly used as wrappers to easily run other genomics or phylogenetics programs on a bunch of files.
